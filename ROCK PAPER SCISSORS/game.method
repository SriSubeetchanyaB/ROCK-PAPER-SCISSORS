HTML Structure

1. Start the HTML file with <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.

2.  Inside the <body>, add a heading:
  “Rock Paper Scissors” (this is just for the title on the screen).

3. Create 3 buttons — one for each option:
	•	Rock
	•	Paper
	•	Scissors

4.  When the user clicks any of these buttons, a function called playGame() is triggered.
	•	This function receives the user’s selected move as input (for example: 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors').

JavaScript Logic

Main Function: playGame(playerMove)

5.  The function playGame() receives the player’s selected move.

6.  Inside this function, call another function named pickComputerMove().
	•	This function will randomly select a move for the computer.

7.  Now compare the player’s move with the computer’s move:
	•	If both moves are the same → It’s a Tie.
	•	If player move beats computer move → Player wins.
	•	Otherwise → Computer wins.

8.  The comparisons are handled using simple if-else statements for all possible combinations.

9.  After deciding the result, show a popup box using alert() displaying:
	•	What the player picked.
	•	What the computer picked.
	•	Who won the round.

Example alert message:
“You picked rock. Computer picked scissors. You win.”


Function for Random Computer Move: pickComputerMove()

10.  Inside this function, generate a random number between 0 and 1 using Math.random().

11. Based on the random number, assign the computer’s move:
	•	If random number is between 0 and less than 1/3 → Computer picks rock.
	•	If random number is between 1/3 and less than 2/3 → Computer picks paper.
	•	If random number is between 2/3 and 1 → Computer picks scissors.

12.  Finally, return this randomly selected computer move back to the playGame() function.
